Threads are often provided in the form of a thread package

for user level threads, the price of creating a thread is primarily determined by the cost
for allocating memory to set up a thread stack

a **daemon** is a background process that runs continuously and performs specific tasks without direct interaction from a user
**Characteristics of Daemons**
1. **Background Process** – Runs in the background, not directly tied to a terminal or user session.
2. **Autonomous** – Starts automatically at system boot or when needed.
3. **Service-Oriented** – Provides services to other programs or system components, e.g., network services, logging, printing.
4. **Long-Lived** – Often runs indefinitely, waiting for events or requests.
