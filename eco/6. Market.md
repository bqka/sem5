### Definition of Perfect Competition

**Ans Perfect Competition!** - Perfect Competition is the market situation in which buyers and sellers operate freely and a commodity sells at a uniform price.
**OR**
It is the market in which a very large number of firms produce homogeneous goods and sell them at a uniform price.
### Features of Perfect Competition

**1) Very large numbers of buyers and sellers:**
The number of buyers and sellers is so large that none of them can influence the prevailing price in the market. Each buyer and seller buys or sells a very insignificant proportion of the total supply of the commodity in the market. This shows the ineffectiveness of a seller or buyer. In fact, the price is determined by aggregate demand and aggregate supply in the whole industry.

**II) Homogeneous Product:-**
Products sold in the perfect market are homogeneous i.e. they are identical in all respects like quality, color, size, weight, design etc. They are perfect substitutes of one another. The products sold by different firms in the market are identical in the eyes of the buyers. Since, a buyer can't distinguish between the products of one firm and that of another, he becomes indifferent as to the firms from which he buys.

**III) Free entry & exit of firms:-**
Buyers & sellers are free to enter or leave the market or industry at any time they like. New firms induced by large profits can enter the industry whereas losses make the inefficient firms to leave the industry. In case of abnormal profit at the profit max level of output, new firms will be attracted to the industry. This will lead to an increase in supply leading to a fall in price of profit. Thus, the entry process of firms will continue till there are no abnormal profits. On the contrary, if there are losses due to low price, firms will quit the industry leading to a fall in supply. As a result, the price will rise lessening the losses. Thus, the exit process of firms will continue till there are no losses. Hence, free entry & exit imply zero normal profit.

**IV) Perfect Knowledge**
The buyers & sellers have perfect knowledge about the prices prevailing in different parts of the market. All sellers have equal access to technology & input with the result that all firms have uniform unit cost. Clearly, this leads to an emergence of a uniform price of the product.

**V) Perfect Mobility:-**
There is a perfect mobility of goods and factors of production without any obstruction. The factors are free to enter in an industry if considered profitable or leave the industry when remuneration is inadequate.

**VI) Absence of Transport Cost -**
In perfect competition, it is assumed that there is no transport cost for consumers who may buy from any firm. This ensures the existence of a single uniform price of the product.

**VII) Demand (AR) Curve is perfectly elastic || to x-axis:-**
In perfect competition, the demand curve facing an individual seller is horizontal in shape or parallel to the x-axis. The reason is that the firm has no option but to accept it. It may sell as many units of the commodity as it wishes at the price given by the industry.

**(viii) Firm is price-taker & industry is price-maker:-**
In PC, the price is determined by the industry & all the firms accept it.

### Monopoly

**Q. Write the definition of monopoly & explain its features.**

**Ans.** 'Mono' literally means 'one', 'Poly' means 'seller', so monopoly means 'one seller'.

**DEFINITION**
Monopoly is a market situation where there is a single firm selling the commodity & there is no close substitute for a commodity sold by the monopolists. It is very difficult for a new firm to enter the monopoly market.
#### FEATURES OF MONOPOLY

**1) Single seller of the commodity:-**
There is only one seller/producer of the commodity in the market. As a result, the monopoly firm has full control over the supply of the commodity. The monopolist may be an individual, a firm, a group of firms, a govt. corp. or even the govt itself.

**II) Absence of close substitutes of the product:-**
The product sold by the monopolist has no close substitute. Though some substitutes of the product may be available yet they are not close substitutes. That means that such substitutes are not identical to the product. As a result, the consumer will have to buy the commodity from the monopolist or go without it.

**III) Difficult entry of a new firm:-**
The monopolist controls the situation in such a way that it becomes very difficult for a new firm to enter the monopoly market & compete with the monopolist by producing a homogeneous or identical product. The monopolist prevents the entry of a new firm. This barrier can be economic, institutional or artificial in nature. As a result, a monopoly firm earns abnormal profit in the long run due to blocked entry of new firms.

**IV) -vely sloped Demand Curve:-**
The Demand Curve (or AR Curve) facing a monopolist is negatively sloped which indicates that a monopolist can sell more only by lowering the price. Since the monopolist is the only seller in the market, therefore the demand curve facing him is the market demand curve.

**V) Price-maker with constraint-**
A monopoly firm is the only seller & having no competitor, it can fix the price partially. It has substantial influence over the price of his product by manipulating its supply. It is because of this position, the monopolist is said to be a price-maker.

**VI) Price-discrimination**
Unlike the uniform price at which a product is sold in competition, a monopolist can charge different prices for his product from different persons & in different market areas.

**Types of Price discrimination:**
1) Price Acc. to Person
2) Acc. to Place
3) Acc. to Use
4) Acc. to Time

### MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION

Monopolistic Competition refers to a market situation in which there are many firms selling closely related but differentiated products. For eg:- Markets of products like toothpastes, shoes, cycles, TV sets etc. are examples of monopolistic competition.

#### FEATURES

**1) Large no. of firms -**
The no. of firms selling a similar product is fairly large but not very large as in perfect competition. Each supplying a small percentage of the total supply of the product. As a result, firms are in a position to influence marginally the price of their product. For instance, among toothpastes of different brand names, Colgate toothpaste sells at a comparatively higher price.

**II) Product differentiation**
This is the most important feature of monopolistic competition. Differentiated products are variants of a commodity. Products are not identical or homogeneous. They are closely related but not homogeneous. Each firm produces the same product which can be differentiated from other firms. Products are not the same but they are closely similar to each other. They can be differentiated from each other on the basis of brand name, shape, colour, quality etc. For instance, toilet soaps like Liril, Hamam, Pears, Lifebuoy etc. belong to this category.

**III) Free entry and exit of firms:-**
New firms can enter the market if found profitable. Similarly, inefficient firms already operating in the market are free to quit the market if they incur losses. It is because of this feature that like perfect competition, monopolistic competition also gives rise to normal profit. Free entry & exit imply that abnormal profit is driven to zero.

**IV) Selling Costs:-**
Selling costs are the expenses which are incurred for promoting sales or for inducing customers to buy the good of a particular brand. These include the cost of advertisement through newspapers, TV and radio, show windows, free sampling, salaries of salesman & costs on other sales promotion activities. These costs are also called advertisement costs - are undertaken to increase the demand for a product or to persuade buyers to buy the product of the firm in preference to others.

**V) Demand Curve**
The demand curve or AR Curve faced by a firm is negatively sloped i.e. downward sloping because the firm can sell more only by lowering the price of its product. The demand curve in Monopolistic Competition is highly elastic due to the availability of close substitutes.

### OLIGOPOLY

It is that form of imperfect competition where a few big firms compete for their homogeneous product like cement or differentiated products like cars. There is interdependence of firms with regard to price-output decision. Mostly, prices are stable. Here, entry of a new firm is quite difficult.

#### FEATURES

**I) A few firms:-**
There are a few firms controlling the market. Each firm produces a substantial part of the total output of the industry. The number of firms is so small that an action by one can influence the price by his own. He can provoke rivals to react.

**II) Interdependence -**
There is interdependence of firms in the case of price-output decisions as no firm can take such an independent decision. Interdependence means that the actions of one firm affect the actions of other firms.

**III) Selling Costs**
Heavy selling/advertisement costs are incurred to promote sales.

**IV) Price rigidity:**
Mostly prices are stable since no firm desires to start a price war for fear of retaliation by rival firms. Firms generally keep prices at similar levels to avoid a price war.

**V) Indeterminate demand curve**
No firm can be certain of the demand for its product due to the unsure reaction of rival firms. So the demand curve for its product is indeterminate.

**VI) Group behaviour**
Group behaviour in the form of collective decisions by firms is common. This is the main cause of price rigidity.

**VII) Homogeneous or differentiated product**
The product may be homogeneous like steel or differentiated like cars.

**VIII) Difficult Entry**
Entry of new firms in the industry is difficult. So firms continue to earn abnormal profits in the long run.

**Define Cartel.**
**Ans.** A Cartel is a group of firms which jointly sets output and price so as to exercise monopoly power. e.g. OPEC [Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Companies]

# Tools of Monetary Policy

## 1. Quantitative Methods
Quantitative methods affect the volume of credit in the economy. These methods include the following:
### (a) Bank Rate
The bank rate is the traditional method of credit control used by a central bank. It is the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks or rediscounts approved first-class bills of exchange and government securities held by the commercial banks. Changes in the bank rate affect the money supply in the economy. The bank rate specifically refers to the interest rate at which a country's central bank lends money to member banks for a long period as a lender of the last resort.
#### Increase in Bank Rate
During inflation (a state of rising prices), the central bank raises its bank rate to control the volume of credit. This increases the cost of borrowing for commercial banks. An increase in the bank rate causes commercial banks to raise their own lending interest rates. This, in turn, discourages businesses and others from borrowing, leading to a reduction in the volume of credit and the money supply.
#### Decrease in Bank Rate
During deflation (a state of falling prices), the central bank reduces the bank rate. This makes borrowing from the central bank cheaper for commercial banks, which then also reduce their lending rates. Businessmen are encouraged to borrow more, which leads to an expansion of credit and the money supply. Consequently, output, employment, income, and aggregate demand begin to rise.

### Box 6.1: Bank Rate, Repo Rate and Reverse Repo Rate
* **Bank Rate:** This is the interest rate at which the central bank lends money to member banks for a long period as a lender of last resort. Unlike a repo rate, it does not involve a condition for the banks to repurchase securities. The RBI has now largely replaced the bank rate with the repo rate to influence credit and interest rates in the country.
* **Repo Rate:** The repo (re-purchase option) rate is the market interest rate at which the central bank lends money to banks for a short period. Commercial banks receive these loans by selling securities to the central bank under the condition that they will repurchase the securities after a fixed time at a predetermined price.
* **Reverse Repo Rate:** This is the interest rate at which the central bank (RBI) borrows from commercial banks for short periods. This is done by selling government bonds to the banks. Banks use the reverse repo facility to deposit their short-term excess funds with the central bank and earn interest.

### (b) Open Market Operations (OMO)
OMO refers to the buying and selling of government securities (like National Saving Certificates) by the central bank from or to the public and banks to influence the money supply. Whether securities are bought from or sold to the public or banks, the money is ultimately transferred from or deposited into banks.
#### Sale of Securities
During periods of excess demand or inflation, the central bank sells government securities. This reduces the cash resources of commercial banks, limiting their ability to lend to businesses. As a result, the volume of credit and money supply in the economy decreases, causing the level of aggregate demand to fall.

#### Purchase of Securities
During periods of deficient demand or deflation, the central bank starts purchasing securities from the market.

---

### (c) Legal Reserve Requirements

#### (i) Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
CRR is the minimum percentage of total demand and time deposits that commercial banks must keep with the central bank. Changes in the CRR affect a commercial bank's power to create credit.

* **Increase in CRR:** An increase in the CRR reduces the excess reserves of commercial banks, which limits their lending power. CRR is typically raised during periods of excess demand or inflation to decrease the aggregate demand.
* **Decrease in CRR:** During deflation or deficient demand, the central bank decreases the CRR. This increases the banks' excess reserves and enhances their ability to lend. CRR is reduced when the expansion of credit or money supply is needed.

#### (ii) Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)
SLR is the minimum percentage of net demand and time deposits that commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves in the form of cash or other liquid assets.

* **Increase in SLR:** The central bank increases the SLR during periods of excess demand or inflation. This reduces the excess reserves* of banks and their ability to extend credit, which in turn decreases the aggregate demand.
* **Decrease in SLR:** The central bank reduces the SLR during deflation when aggregate demand is low. This increases the excess reserves of banks and enhances their ability to give credit.

excess reserves - reserve available for lending

## 2. Qualitative Methods
Also known as selective methods, these direct or restrict the flow of credit to specific areas of economic activity to control who gets more or less credit.

### (a) Regulation of Consumer's Credit
Under this method, the credit given for durable consumer goods (like cars, houses, computers) purchased under a 'Hire Purchase System' is controlled.

### (d) Moral Suasion
The central bank uses persuasion and pressure to encourage commercial banks to align with its policy. This is done through letters, discussions, and directives. Member banks generally follow the central bank's advice.
