# Tools of Monetary Policy

## 1. Quantitative Methods
Quantitative methods affect the volume of credit in the economy. These methods include the following:

---

### (a) Bank Rate
The bank rate is the traditional method of credit control used by a central bank. It is the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks or rediscounts approved first-class bills of exchange and government securities held by the commercial banks. Changes in the bank rate affect the money supply in the economy. The bank rate specifically refers to the interest rate at which a country's central bank lends money to member banks for a long period as a lender of the last resort.

#### Increase in Bank Rate
During inflation (a state of rising prices), the central bank raises its bank rate to control the volume of credit. This increases the cost of borrowing for commercial banks. An increase in the bank rate causes commercial banks to raise their own lending interest rates. This, in turn, discourages businesses and others from borrowing, leading to a reduction in the volume of credit and the money supply.

#### Decrease in Bank Rate
During deflation (a state of falling prices), the central bank reduces the bank rate. This makes borrowing from the central bank cheaper for commercial banks, which then also reduce their lending rates. Businessmen are encouraged to borrow more, which leads to an expansion of credit and the money supply. Consequently, output, employment, income, and aggregate demand begin to rise.

### Box 6.1: Bank Rate, Repo Rate and Reverse Repo Rate
* **Bank Rate:** This is the interest rate at which the central bank lends money to member banks for a long period as a lender of last resort. Unlike a repo rate, it does not involve a condition for the banks to repurchase securities. The RBI has now largely replaced the bank rate with the repo rate to influence credit and interest rates in the country.
* **Repo Rate:** The repo (re-purchase option) rate is the market interest rate at which the central bank lends money to banks for a short period. Commercial banks receive these loans by selling securities to the central bank under the condition that they will repurchase the securities after a fixed time at a predetermined price.
* **Reverse Repo Rate:** This is the interest rate at which the central bank (RBI) borrows from commercial banks for short periods. This is done by selling government bonds to the banks. Banks use the reverse repo facility to deposit their short-term excess funds with the central bank and earn interest.

### (b) Open Market Operations (OMO)
OMO refers to the buying and selling of government securities (like National Saving Certificates) by the central bank from or to the public and banks to influence the money supply. Whether securities are bought from or sold to the public or banks, the money is ultimately transferred from or deposited into banks.

#### Sale of Securities
During periods of excess demand or inflation, the central bank sells government securities. This reduces the cash resources of commercial banks, limiting their ability to lend to businesses. As a result, the volume of credit and money supply in the economy decreases, causing the level of aggregate demand to fall.

#### Purchase of Securities
During periods of deficient demand or deflation, the central bank starts purchasing securities from the market.

### (c) Legal Reserve Requirements

#### (i) Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
CRR is the minimum percentage of total demand and time deposits that commercial banks must keep with the central bank. Changes in the CRR affect a commercial bank's power to create credit.

* **Increase in CRR:** An increase in the CRR reduces the excess reserves of commercial banks, which limits their lending power. CRR is typically raised during periods of excess demand or inflation to decrease the aggregate demand.
* **Decrease in CRR:** During deflation or deficient demand, the central bank decreases the CRR. This increases the banks' excess reserves and enhances their ability to lend. CRR is reduced when the expansion of credit or money supply is needed.

#### (ii) Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)
SLR is the minimum percentage of net demand and time deposits that commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves in the form of cash or other liquid assets.

* **Increase in SLR:** The central bank increases the SLR during periods of excess demand or inflation. This reduces the excess reserves of banks and their ability to extend credit, which in turn decreases the aggregate demand.
* **Decrease in SLR:** The central bank reduces the SLR during deflation when aggregate demand is low. This increases the excess reserves of banks and enhances their ability to give credit.

## 2. Qualitative Methods
Also known as selective methods, these direct or restrict the flow of credit to specific areas of economic activity to control who gets more or less credit.

### (a) Regulation of Consumer's Credit
Under this method, the credit given for durable consumer goods (like cars, houses, computers) purchased under a 'Hire Purchase System' is controlled.

### (d) Moral Suasion
The central bank uses persuasion and pressure to encourage commercial banks to align with its policy. This is done through letters, discussions, and directives. Member banks generally follow the central bank's advice.
