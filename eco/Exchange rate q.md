**Ques What are the different types of Exchange Rate? Explain it.**

Ans: There are Various Concept of Rate of Exchange System. Two broad concepts are fixed exchange rate and flexible exchange rate as explained below. In between those two extreme rates, there are some hybrid systems like Managed Floating etc. Which are briefly discussed in the following manner.

**A. FIXED EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM:** The System of Exchange rate in which exchange rate is Officially fixed or pegged in term of gold or any other Currency by the govt. is called fixed exchange rate System.

**ADVANTAGES:**
1. It Contributes to the Co-ordination of new policies of Countries in an interdependent world economy.
2. Fixed exchange rate ensure that major economic distributions in the member Countries do not Occur.

3. Fixed exchange rate are more Conducive to expansion of world trade because it prevents risk and uncertainty in transactions.

This System has many drawbacks which were witnessed during its operation. Therefore, many Critics have Suggested an alternative System of flexible exchange rate.

**B. FLEXIBLE (FLOATING) EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM:** The System of exchange rate in which value of Currency is allowed to Adjust freely as determined by demand for and Supply of foreign exchange.

**ADVANTAGES**
1. Flexible exchange rate eliminates the need for Central banks to hold international reserves.
2. Such rates are helpful in removing the barriers to trade and Capital movements.

**C. Managed Floating:** This system is a hybrid of fixed exchange rate and flexible exchange rate. Under this system, central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market to restrict the fluctuations in the exchange rate within certain limits. The exchange rate is determined by the market forces.

**Ques: what are the Sources of demand for foreign Exchange?**

Ans: Payment in foreign Exchange causes demand for foreign exchange. The following factors cause demand for foreign exchange.

**SOURCE OF DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE**
(I) To purchase goods and Services from foreign Countries.
(Ⅱ) To purchase financial assets (i.e. to invest in bonds and equity Shares) in a foreign Country.
(Ⅲ) To invest directly in Shops, factory buildings in a foreign Country.
(IV) To Speculate on the Value of foreign Currencies.
(V) To Send gifts abroad.
(VI). To Undertake foreign tours and Remittance to their families by foreigners working, Say in India.

**Ques: What are the Sources of Supply for foreign Exchange?**

Ans: Receipt in foreign Exchange results in Supply of foreign Exchange. The following factors may cause Supply of foreign Exchange. As a result, foreign Currency flows into a domestic economy.

**SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE**
(A) When foreigners purchase home Country Goods and services through export (By India)
(B) When foreigners invest in bonds and equity Shares of the home Countries.
(C) When Currency dealers and Speculators Cause flow of foreign Currency in the domestic Economy.
(D) When Indian Workers working Abroad Send their Savings to families in India.
(E) When foreign tourists Come to India.

**Ques: How is Foreign Exchange Rate determined ? Explain with the help of diagrams.**

Ans: In the freely fluctuating exchange market, the exchange rate of a Currency, like the price of a Commodity, is determined by demand and Supply of foreign Exchange, in the foreign Exchange Market.

Graphically expressed, the intersection of the demand and the Supply Curve determines the equilibrium exchange rate and equilibrium quantity of foreign Currency.

**Equilibrium Exchange Rate:** It is determined at a point where demand for and supply of foreign Exchange are equal.

(Diagram showing intersection of Demand and Supply curves for US dollars)

* **Y-axis:** Price of dollar in term of Rupees
* **X-axis:** Demand & Supply of dollar
* **D curve:** Demand
* **S curve:** Supply
* **E:** Equilibrium point where D and S intersect
* **R:** Equilibrium price
* **Q:** Equilibrium quantity

In the Above diagram, the demand Curve and Supply Curve of the dollar intersect each Other at point E.

# Page 6

This implies that at an exchange rate of OR, the quantity demanded and Supplied are equal (both are equal to OQ). Hence the equilibrium rate is OR and equilibrium quantity is OQ.

**Change in Exchange Rate**

**If Increase in India's demand for US dollar:**

(Diagram showing a rightward shift of the demand curve)

* An Increase in India's demand for US dollar will Cause the demand Curve DD to Shift to D1D1.
* As a result, the exchange rate will rise from OR to OR1. It shows depreciation of Indian Currency because more money is required to buy one US dollar.

(Diagram showing a rightward shift of the supply curve)

**If Increase in India's Supply for US dollar:**

* An Increase in Supply of US dollar will Cause Supply Curve SS to Shift to S1S1.
* As a result, the exchange rate will fall from OR to OR1.
* It Indicates appreciation of Indian Currency because the Cost of a US dollar in terms of rupees has now fallen, which means less rupees are required to buy one US dollar.

**Appreciation of a Currency:** It is an increase in its Value in terms of another foreign Currency. Thus, Currency Appreciation takes place when there is a decrease in the domestic Currency price of foreign Currency. For Instance, if the Value of a rupee in terms of US dollar increases from Rs. 50 to 49 to a dollar, it will be Called Appreciation of Indian Currency (i.e. rupee) because fewer rupees are required to buy One US dollar.

**Depreciation of a Currency:** It is the fall in its Value in terms of another foreign Currency. Thus Currency Depreciation takes place when there is an increase in the domestic Currency price of the foreign Currency. For Instance, if the Value of rupees in terms of US dollar falls, Say from Rs. 50 to 51 to a dollar, it will be a Case of depreciation of the Indian rupee because more rupees are required to buy One US dollar.

**Foreign exchange:** All currencies other than the domestic currency of a given country are called foreign exchange.

**Foreign Exchange Rate:** It is the rate at which one currency is exchanged for the other. It measures the number of units of one currency required to exchange with one unit of another.

**Currency Appreciation and Currency Depreciation:** Currency appreciation means a rise in the price of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency. The domestic currency becomes more valuable and less of it is required to buy per unit of foreign currency. A fall in the price of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency is called currency depreciation. The domestic currency becomes cheaper and more of it is required to buy a unit of foreign currency.

**Devaluation and Revaluation:** Devaluation means a reduction in the external value of domestic currency by the government. And revaluation denotes an increase in the external value of domestic currency by the government.

**Types of Foreign Exchange Rate:**
Three main types of exchange rate systems are:

**4. Foreign Exchange Market**

**4.1 Meaning**
Foreign exchange market refers to the market in which national currencies are traded for one another. The major participants in this market are commercial banks, foreign exchange brokers and other authorized dealers and the monetary authorities.

**4.2 Functions**
Foreign exchange market performs mainly the following three functions:

(i) **Transfer function:** It transfers purchasing power between the countries involved in the transaction. This function is called transfer function.

(ii) **Credit function:** It provides credit for foreign trade. Bills of exchange with a maturity period of three months, are generally used for international payments. Credit is required for this period in order to enable the importers to take delivery of goods, sell them and obtain money to pay off the bill. This function is called credit function.

(iii) **Hedging function:** When exporters and importers enter into an agreement to sell and buy goods on some future date at an exchange rate agreed upon today, it is called hedging.
