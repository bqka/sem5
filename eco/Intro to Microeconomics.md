# Microeconomics and Macroeconomics: An Introduction

Economics is broadly divided into two parts: **microeconomics** and **macroeconomics**. These terms were first introduced by the economist Ragnar Frisch. Microeconomics focuses on the economic behavior of individuals, while macroeconomics studies the choice-making behavior of society as a whole.

## Microeconomics

The word 'micro' comes from the Greek word '*mikros*,' meaning small. Therefore, microeconomics deals with small parts of the economy, studying the behavior of individual economic units like consumers, producers, and resource owners. The letter 'I' in MICRO can be thought of as standing for **individuals**.

Every consumer allocates resources to maximize their satisfaction, and every producer allocates resources to maximize their profits. Since prices have a significant effect on these individual decisions, microeconomics is sometimes called **'price theory'**.

### Scope of Microeconomics

Microeconomics addresses the following key areas:
* **Theory of Demand**: How individual consumers spend their income on various goods and services.
* **Theory of Production**: How producers utilize different factors of production.
* **Theory of Cost**: How producers minimize the cost of production.
* **Theory of Product Pricing**: How the prices of different goods are determined.
* **Theory of Distribution (Factor Pricing)**: How the output is distributed among the different factors of production.
* **Welfare Economics**: Whether resources are allocated efficiently to maximize output and welfare.

## Macroeconomics

The term 'macro' is derived from the Greek word '*makros*,' which means large. Macroeconomics studies the economy as a whole and its aggregates, such as gross domestic product, total employment, and the general price level. The letter 'A' in MACRO can be thought of as standing for **aggregates**. Because it focuses on aggregates, macroeconomics is also known as "**aggregative economics**".

According to Professor Boulding, "Macroeconomics deals not with individual quantities as such but with aggregates of these quantities, not with individual incomes but with the national income, not with the individual output but the national output."

### Scope of Macroeconomics

Macroeconomics explains the following:
* **Theory of Income and Employment**: How national income and total output are determined.
* **General Price Level**: It explains inflation (rising prices) and deflation (falling prices).
* **Economic Growth and Development**: It studies the issues concerned with long-term economic progress.
* **International Trade**: It describes issues related to trade between nations and the determination of foreign currency prices.

## Distinction between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

| Basis                 | Microeconomics                                                                                             | Macroeconomics                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Meaning** | The study of individual economic units of an economy, such as a consumer or a producer.                      | The study of the economy as a whole and its aggregates, such as national income and the general price level.   |
| **Scope** | Primarily concerned with determining the relative prices of individual goods.                              | Concerned with determining aggregate output and the general price level in the economy as a whole.            |
| **Tools** | Demand and supply of a particular commodity or factor of production.                                       | Aggregate demand and aggregate supply of all goods and services.                                               |
| **Degree of Aggregation** | There is a limited amount of aggregation.                                                                  | There is a high degree of aggregation.                                                                         |

### Interdependence

While microeconomics and macroeconomics are separate branches, they are highly interdependent.
* **Dependence of Macroeconomics on Microeconomics**: National income is the sum of individual incomes, and the aggregate demand of an economy depends on the individual demands of different households.
* **Dependence of Microeconomics on Macroeconomics**: Micro variables are affected by macro trends. For instance, the wage rate in a particular industry is influenced by the overall wage rate in the economy, and investment in one industry depends on the overall level of income and investment.

## What is an Economy?

An **economy** refers to the production activities of a well-defined area, such as a village, state, or country. It is a system through which people get a living and satisfy their wants. The size of an economy is determined by the level of its output of goods and services.

For an economy to survive, it must perform three basic activities, known as its vital processes:
1.  **Production**: The process of creating goods and services.
2.  **Consumption**: The use of goods and services to satisfy human wants directly.
3.  **Investment**: The addition to the capital stock of a country that helps in further production.

These three activities are interrelated. Production is meaningless without consumption, and for further production to occur, investment is necessary.

## The Economic Problem

The **economic problem** is the problem of choice that arises from using scarce resources to satisfy unlimited human wants. It is essentially the problem of allocating resources to their alternative uses.

### Causes of the Economic Problem

1.  **Unlimited Human Wants**: Human wants are endless. As one want is satisfied, many others emerge. This forces individuals to make choices among different wants based on their urgency.
2.  **Limited Resources**: The resources (land, labor, capital) required to produce goods and services are scarce compared to the unlimited wants they must satisfy.
3.  **Resources Have Alternative Uses**: Resources can be put to more than one use. For example, a piece of land can be used for farming, a playground, or housing. Using a resource for one purpose means it cannot be used for another, making the resource even more scarce.

Making the best use of available resources is known as the problem of **economizing of resources**.

## Central Problems of an Economy

Every economy faces three basic central problems related to the allocation of resources:

### 1. What to Produce and in What Quantities?

This problem involves two decisions: what goods to produce and how much of each good to produce. Since resources are scarce, producing more of one commodity means producing less of another. An economy must choose between producing consumer goods (like cloth and sugar) and capital goods (like machines), or between war goods (like guns) and normal goods (like bread).

### 2. How to Produce?

This problem relates to the choice of production technique. A good can be produced using different methods, such as:
* **Labor-intensive techniques** (e.g., handlooms), which can help reduce unemployment.
* **Capital-intensive techniques** (e.g., modern machines), which can lead to faster economic growth.
The guiding principle is to adopt the technique that minimizes the per-unit cost of production and ensures goods are produced efficiently.

### 3. For Whom to Produce?

This is the problem of distributing the final goods and services among the population. It has two aspects:
* **Personal Distribution**: How the national output is distributed among individuals and households, which relates to the problem of income inequality.
* **Functional Distribution**: How the output is distributed among the different factors of production (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneur).

## Production Possibility Curve (PPC)

A **Production Possibility Curve (PPC)**, also known as a Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) or Transformation Curve, is a graph that shows the various possible combinations of two goods that can be produced with full and efficient use of available resources and technology.

### Production Possibilities Schedule

| Production Possibility | Cloth (Thousand Meters) | Wheat (Thousand Quintals) |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------ |
| A                       | 0                       | 15                        |
| B                       | 1                       | 14                        |
| C                       | 2                       | 12                        |
| D                       | 3                       | 9                         |
| E                       | 4                       | 5                         |
| F                       | 5                       | 0                         |

* **Attainable Combinations**: Any point on or inside the PPC is attainable. Points on the curve represent the full and efficient utilization of resources. Points inside the curve represent inefficient utilization.
* **Unattainable Combinations**: Any point outside the PPC is unattainable with the current resources and technology.

### Assumptions of the PPC

The concept of the PPC is based on the following assumptions:
* The available resources are fixed.
* The technology remains unchanged.
* The resources are fully and efficiently employed.
* The resources are not equally efficient in the production of all goods.
