## Cardinal Utility Analysis

### Core Concepts

* **Utility**: Utility is the power or capacity of a commodity to satisfy a human want. Utility can be measured in 'Utils'.
* **Marginal Utility (MU)**: MU is the additional or extra utility derived from the consumption of an additional unit of a commodity.
    * It can be expressed as: $MU_n = TU_n - TU_{n-1}$.
    * Or as the rate of change: $MU = \frac{\Delta TU}{\Delta Q}$, where $\Delta TU$ is the change in Total Utility and $\Delta Q$ is the change in quantity consumed.
* **Total Utility (TU)**: It is the total psychological satisfaction a consumer derives from consuming a given amount of a particular commodity. It is the sum of all marginal utilities.

### Relationship between Total Utility (TU) and Marginal Utility (MU)

The relationship can be illustrated with the following table:

| Units Consumed | Total Utility (TU) | Marginal Utility (MU) |
| :------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------- |
| 1              | 10                 | 10                    |
| 2              | 18                 | 8                     |
| 3              | 23                 | 5                     |
| 4              | 25                 | 2                     |
| 5              | 26                 | 1                     |
| 6              | 26                 | 0                     |
| 7              | 23                 | -3                    |

**Key Relationships:**
1.  TU increases as long as MU is positive.
2.  TU is maximum when MU is zero.
3.  TU starts declining when MU becomes negative.

### Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

The law states that as more and more units of a commodity are consumed, the marginal utility derived from each successive unit goes on falling. For example, the utility from the first chapati for a hungry person is maximum, lesser from the second, and still lesser from the third, and so on.

**Assumptions of the Law:**
* All units of consumption are homogeneous and of a standard size.
* Consumption is continuous, with no time interval between the consumption of units.

### Consumer's Equilibrium (Cardinal Approach)

Consumer's Equilibrium refers to a situation where a consumer spends their given income on a commodity or combination of goods in a way that provides maximum satisfaction or utility. This can be discussed in two situations: when one commodity is consumed, and when two or more are consumed.

#### Case 1: One Commodity

A consumer is in equilibrium when the marginal utility of a commodity (measured in monetary units) is equal to the price of that commodity.

**Example:** Assume 1 Rupee = 4 Utils. Price of ice cream is ₹20 per unit.

| Units of Ice Cream | MU (Utils) | MU in Money (₹) | Price (₹) |
| :----------------- | :--------- | :-------------- | :-------- |
| 1                  | 120        | 30              | 20        |
| 2                  | 100        | 25              | 20        |
| 3                  | 80         | 20              | 20        |
| 4                  | 60         | 15              | 20        |
| 5                  | 40         | 10              | 20        |
| 6                  | 20         | 5               | 20        |

The consumer will be in equilibrium when consuming 3 units of ice cream because at this level, the marginal utility in monetary units (₹20) is equal to the price (₹20).

#### Case 2: Two Commodities

Two necessary conditions must be met for consumer equilibrium:
1.  The ratio of marginal utility to price is the same for both goods, also known as the Law of Equi-Marginal Utility. The formula is: $\frac{MU_x}{P_x} = \frac{MU_y}{P_y}$.
2.  MU falls as consumption increases.

**What happens in a state of disequilibrium?**
* If $\frac{MU_x}{P_x} > \frac{MU_y}{P_y}$, the consumer gets more marginal utility per rupee from good X. They will buy more of X and less of Y. This causes $MU_x$ to fall until the ratio becomes equal.
* If $\frac{MU_x}{P_x} < \frac{MU_y}{P_y}$, the consumer gets more marginal utility per rupee from good Y. They will buy more of Y and less of X. This causes $MU_y$ to fall until the ratio becomes equal.

## Ordinal Utility Analysis (Indifference Curve Approach)

* **Cardinal Utility**: An approach, given by Alfred Marshal, where utility is measured in cardinal numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc..
* **Ordinal Utility**: An approach, given by Prof. Hicks and Allen, where utility is ranked, such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc..

### Indifference Curve (IC)

An Indifference Curve shows different combinations of two goods that provide the same level of satisfaction (utility) to the consumer.

| Combination | Good X | Good Y | MRS ($\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}$) |
| :---------- | :----- | :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| A           | 1      | 10     | -                                 |
| B           | 2      | 7      | 3:1                               |
| C           | 3      | 5      | 2:1                               |
| D           | 4      | 4      | 1:1                               |

* **Indifference Map**: A set of indifference curves drawn on a graph.
![[Pasted image 20250921012410.png|400]]
* **Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)**: The amount of good Y that a consumer is willing to give up to consume one additional unit of good X while keeping total utility unchanged. The formula is $MRS = \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}$.
* **Monotonic Preference**: The preference of a consumer for more goods over less.

### Properties of Indifference Curves

1.  **An IC always slopes downwards from left to right**: This is because if a consumer wants more of one good (X), they must give up some quantity of the other good (Y) to maintain the same level of satisfaction.
2.  **Indifference curves are always convex to the origin**: This implies that the slope of the IC (the MRS) decreases as we move down the curve. This is based on the assumption of a decreasing marginal rate of substitution.
3.  **A higher indifference curve represents a higher level of satisfaction**: A bundle on a higher IC contains more of at least one good, and more goods imply more utility.

4.  **Two indifference curves never intersect each other**: If they did, it would imply a contradiction. A single point (the intersection) would represent two different levels of satisfaction, which is impossible.

### Budget Line

![[Pasted image 20250921013441.png|400]]
A budget line shows the different possible combinations of two goods that a consumer can purchase, given their entire money income and the market prices of the goods.
* **Equation**: $P_1X_1 + P_2X_2 = M$.
* **Budget Set**: This consists of all possible combinations of two goods that a consumer can afford with their income at prevailing prices. It includes bundles on or below the budget line. The equation is $P_1X_1 + P_2X_2 \leq M$.
* **Shift in Budget Line**: Occurs when the consumer's income changes.
    * An increase in income shifts the line outward (to the right).
    * A decrease in income shifts the line inward (to the left).
	![[Pasted image 20250921013508.png|500]]
* **Rotation of Budget Line**: Occurs when the price of one of the commodities changes while the other remains constant.
    * If the price of X falls, the line rotates outward on the X-axis. If it rises, it rotates inward.
    * If the price of Y falls, the line rotates outward on the Y-axis. If it rises, it rotates inward.

### Consumer's Equilibrium (Ordinal Approach)

A consumer reaches equilibrium under the following conditions:

1.  The Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) is equal to the price ratio of the two goods.
    * $MRS_{xy} = \frac{P_x}{P_y}$.
    * This means the slope of the budget line is equal to the slope of the indifference curve, or the budget line is tangent to the indifference curve.
2.  The indifference curve is convex to the origin at the point of equilibrium. This implies a diminishing MRS.


**What happens in a state of disequilibrium?**
* If $MRS_{xy} > \frac{P_x}{P_y}$, it means the consumer is willing to sacrifice more of Y for one unit of X than the market requires. This induces the consumer to buy more of X and less of Y, which causes the MRS to fall until it equals the price ratio.
* If $MRS_{xy} < \frac{P_x}{P_y}$, it means the consumer is willing to sacrifice less of Y for one unit of X than the market requires. This induces the consumer to buy less of X and more of Y, which causes the MRS to rise until it equals the price ratio.

### Assumptions of Indifference Curve Analysis

* **Utility is Ordinal**: Utility is a psychological phenomenon and can only be ranked (1st, 2nd, etc.), not measured in cardinal numbers.
* **Two Goods**: It is assumed the consumer buys only two goods.
* **More is Better**: The consumer always prefers more of any good to less of it, meaning they have not reached the point of satiety.
* **Rational Consumer**: The consumer is assumed to be rational and always tries to maximize their satisfaction in any given situation.
