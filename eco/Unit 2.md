### 1. Barter System of Exchange

#### 1.1 Meaning of Barter Exchange
 Barter means exchange of goods for goods. An economy, where there is a direct barter of goods and services, is called a 'Barter Economy' or 'C - C Economy' (where C - C stands for commodity to commodity).

#### Difficulties of Barter System
Bayer system of exchange suffers from the following drawbacks.

**(1) Lack of double coincidence of wants:** The barter system requires a double coincidence of wants on the part of those who want to exchange goods or services. For example, suppose a farmer possesses wheat and wants to exchange it for cloth. In the barter system, he has to find out a person who not only has cloth but also wants wheat in return. But, such a double coincidence is a rare possibility. Imagine how much effort (physical labour) it will require to find such a person. Moreover, it also involves waiting for the appropriate person. Waiting involves discomforts which implies disutility. Efforts and disutility of discomforts taken together is called trading cost of barter exchange.

**(2) Lack of common measure of value:** Another difficulty of barter is that at what rate any exchange is to be made. There is lack of common measure of value. For example, if there are 1000 goods in the market then the value of each would have to be expressed in terms of 999 goods. The price list then becomes extremely complicated. Not only this, no proper accounting is possible in the absence of common unit of value.

**(3) Problem of future payments:** Thirdly, the barter system lacks a standard of deferred payments. In the absence of money, future payments are not possible because of the following reasons:
(a) The borrower may not be able to arrange exactly the same good and of the same quality at the time of repayment.
(b) There could be disagreement regarding which specific commodity would be used for repayment.
(c) There exists a risk since the commodity may increase or decrease in its value at the time of repayment.

**(4) Problem of storing of value:** Lastly, the barter system does not provide a reliable method of storing value or wealth for future use. Storing of value means storing of the purchasing power i.e., storing of income for future use. Under barter system, it is difficult for people to store wealth for future use. Most of the goods like wheat, rice, vegetables etc. do not possess durability and their quality deteriorates with passage of time. Further, storage of goods require time, money and efforts. It makes their storage very difficult. As a result, goods cannot be used to store wealth for future use.

Due to these above mentioned drawbacks of the barter system, the process of exchange becomes highly inefficient. To overcome these difficulties, money was invented by the society.

### 2. Meaning of Money
Basically, money was introduced as an instrument (or medium) of exchange. Accordingly, money meant anything that act as medium of exchange. With the passage of time, money came to be defined differently. The important definitions of money are explained under the following heads:

**(Diagram: Definition of Money)**
* **Legal Definition:** Anything declared by the government as money is called money.
* **Functional Definition:** Anything that is generally acceptable as a medium of exchange and at the same time acts as a measure and as store of value.
* **Narrow & Broad Definition:**
    * **Narrow Definition:** Money consists of those things only which are used as medium of exchange.
    * **Broad Definition:** Money consists of those things which are used as medium of exchange and also those things which have high degree of moneyness.

![[Pasted image 20250923014446.png]]
#### Legal definition of money
According to this definition, ***money is what the law says is money***. In other words, any thing the government declares it as money is money. A thing will have general acceptability if the law declares it as money. Since it has the legal power to discharge debts, no creditor can refuse it or he may not demand anything else in payment of debt. Currency-notes and coins are legal tender money. It is also called fiat money because it serves as money on the fiat (order) of the government.

#### 2.2 Functional definition of money
 'anything that is generally acceptable as a medium of exchange and at the same time acts as a measure and as store of value'. This is an ideal definition of money because of two reasons:
(i) This definition emphasizes all the important functions of money.
(ii) It stresses upon the basic characteristic of general acceptability.

#### 2.3 Narrow and broad definitions of money
On the basis of scope, money has been defined in two ways: (i) narrow money and (ii) broad money.
Narrow money includes only currency notes and coins. It includes only those things which function as medium of exchange. On the other hand, broad money, besides including notes and coins, also includes some other things in the supply of money that have a high degree of moneyness e.g., time deposits at banks and post offices. These can be converted into ready cash at short notice.

### 3. Classification of Money
Money can be classified as under:
#### 3.1 Full Bodied Money

Full bodied money is that money whose value as a commodity is equal to its value as money. It is also called standard money. When the economies of the world were on gold standard or silver standard, gold coins or silver coins were full bodied money. A rupee coin during the British period in India was made of silver. Its commodity value (i.e., metallic value or intrinsic value) was equal to its money value (i.e., face value).

commodity value = face value
#### 3.2 Credit Money

Credit money refers to that money whose value as money is greater than its commodity value (i.e., value of the material from which it is made). It means face value is greater than intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is the value of the material (metal etc.) contained in the unit of money. Credit money includes the following:
(a) **Token Coins:** (Coins of ₹10, 5, 2, 1 in India are all token coins) since their value as money is far above than the value of metal used in them.
(b) **Circulating Promissory Notes:** Paper notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India (e.g., currency notes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000) fall under this category. We find written on the note, 'I promise to pay the bearer the sum of rupees' signed by the Governor of RBI. Any note is just a piece of paper with a promise on it. These words do not imply its convertibility into gold or silver. Its commodity value is virtually nothing and hence it is credit money.

face value > commodity value
#### 3.3 Legal Tender Money and Optional Money

**(a) Legal Tender Money:** Money which can be legally used to make payment of debt or other obligations is termed as legal tender money. It is also called fiat money as runs by the authority of the government. Currency notes and coins are therefore, called legal tender money. A creditor is obliged by law to accept such money. Legal tender money is of two kinds:

(i) **Limited Legal Tender:** It refers to that form of legal tender money which can be paid in discharge of a debt upto a certain limit. Beyond this limit, a person may refuse to accept the payment and no legal action can be taken against him. In India, coins are limited legal tender.

(ii) **Unlimited Legal Tender**: It refers to that form of legal tender money which can be paid upto any extent. A person has to accept without any maximum limit. Legal action can be taken against a person who refuses to accept this money. In India, paper notes are unlimited legal tender.

**(b) Optional Money:** It refers to that form of money which is generally accepted as medium of exchange, but legally, there is no compulsion to accept it. For example, cheques, bank drafts etc. do not have legal boundation. One may accept or refuse them. It is also called fiduciary money as it is accepted as money on the basis of trust between the payer and payee.

#### 3.4 Bank Money

Bank money refers to the demand deposits of the people at banks. These deposits are payable on demand. Bank money facilitates the exact amount of payments through cheques, drafts etc. It is also called deposit money. Bank money is optional. A person may or may not accept the payment through cheque or draft etc.

### 4. Functions of Money
Money performs several important functions. These functions are classified into two categories:
(1) Primary functions and
(2) Secondary functions

![[Pasted image 20250923020655.png]]
### 5. Supply of Money

#### 5.1 Meaning of Supply of Money
Supply of money is defined as the total stock of all the forms of money (paper money, coins and demand deposits at banks) which are held by the public on a specific day. The term public implies the people using money in carrying out their transactions. In it government and banking system are not included as they are creators (or producers) of money.

**Two Features of Supply of Money:**
(i) **Stock variable:** Supply of money is a stock variable because it is related to a point of time.
(ii) **Money held by the public:** Supply of money always refers to the stock of money held by the public. The stock of money with government, Reserve Bank of India and banking system is not included in supply of money as it does not come into circulation in the country. Supply of money includes that money which belongs to the public for use to carry out transactions.

#### 5.2 Components of Supply of Money
Money supply is composed of the following two elements:
(a) Currency with the public
(b) Demand deposits at banks

**(a) Currency with the public:** Currency with the public include following items:
(i) Currency notes in circulation issued by the Reserve Bank of India.
(ii) Small coins in circulation.

**(b) Demand deposits at banks:** Demand deposits are another important component of money supply. As mentioned earlier, demand deposits with banks are also called bank money. Demand deposits in the banks refer to those deposits which are payable on demand. These are the deposits on which cheques can be written. Through cheques these deposits can be transferred to others for making payments from whom goods and services have been purchased. Thus, cheques make these demand deposits as a medium of exchange and therefore, make them to serve as money.

Note that inter-bank deposits do not constitute part of money supply as they do not belong to the public. Only net demand deposits of commercial banks are included in money supply. The word 'net' here implies only the deposits of public held by banks.

Thus, money supply (M) is composed of currency held by the public (C) and demand deposits with banks (DD).
In short, `M = C + DD`

#### 5.3 Measures of money supply
![[Pasted image 20250923021639.png]]
The Reserve Bank of India has given four measures of money supply viz, M₁, M₂, M₃ and M₄. They are defined as follows:

* **M₁**
    `M₁ = C + DD + OD`
    C is currency held by the public. DD is the demand deposits of people in bank. OD (other deposits) are the demand deposits held by the RBI of Public Financial Institutions (like IDBI), foreign central banks and foreign governments, international financial institutions like IMF. Deposits of government and banks are not included in these other deposits.
    M₁ is the most liquid measure of money supply as all its components are easily used as medium of exchange.

* **M₂**
    It is a broader concept of money supply compared to M₁. Besides M₁, it also includes saving deposits with post offices.
    `M₂ = M₁ + savings deposits with post offices`

* **M₃**
    It is a broader concept. Besides M₁, it also includes net time deposits at banks.
    `M₃ = M₁ + net time deposits of commercial banks`

* **M₄**
    Besides M₃, it includes total deposits with post offices.
    `M₄ = M₃ + total deposits with post offices (excluding National Savings Certificates).`

M₁ and M₂ are called narrow money while M₃ and M₄ are called broad money. This classification is based on the quality of liquidity. Among all the four measures, M₁ is the most liquid while M₄ is the least liquid. By liquidity we mean the conversion of an asset into cash easily and quickly without loss of value. M₃ measure of money supply is known as aggregate monetary resources of the country.

### Simplified Definitions

**1. Narrow Money (M1)**
The most liquid forms of money - meaning they can be used for transactions immediately.
It usually includes:
* Currency in circulation (notes + coins with the public)
* Demand deposits with banks (current + savings accounts that can be withdrawn anytime)
* Other deposits with the central bank (from government/public bodies, if included in a country's definition)
**Key point:** Narrow money = money you can spend right now.

**2. Broad Money (M3)**
A wider measure of money supply. It includes M1 plus less liquid forms of money.
It usually includes:
* M1 (narrow money)
* Time deposits with banks (fixed deposits, recurring deposits, term deposits)
**Key point:** Broad money = M1 + money kept in the bank for longer periods (less liquid, but still part of money supply).

People keep their surplus money in banks. Out of this money, banks give loans to the needy. Thus, banks are important and essential institutions in any modern society. They act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers. In this chapter, we shall discuss the process of money creation by commercial banks.
There exists a supreme institution which is called central bank. It issues currency, acts as banker of the government and of other banks, and controls supply of money and credit to maintain economic stability in the country. We shall also describe the main functions of a central bank.

### 1. Commercial Banks

#### 1.1 Meaning of Commercial Bank
A commercial bank is a financial institution which accepts deposits from the public and gives loans for purposes of consumption and investment.
> "A Banking Company is one which transacts the business of banking which means the accepting for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise and withdrawable by cheque, draft or otherwise." - Banking Companies Act 1949

There are two essential functions that a financial institution must perform to be a commercial bank. These are:
(a) Acceptance of demand deposits that have cheque facilities.
(b) Lending

Acceptance of chequable deposits is necessary, but not sufficient condition for a financial institution to become a commercial bank. For example, post-office savings banks are not banks even though they accept chequable deposits from the public. This is because they do not perform the function of lending. In other words, they do not create demand deposits which are a part of money supply. Similarly, lending alone does not make any financial institution a bank. For example, LIC of India, etc., give loan but they do not accept chequable deposits from the public. These financial institutions also do not create money and hence cannot be called banks.

#### 1.2 Functions of Commercial Banks
Accepting deposits and lending money are the two primary functions of commercial banks.

**(1) Accepting deposits:** The primary function of every commercial bank is to accept deposits from the public. To attract savings, the banks accept mainly three types of deposits:
(a) demand deposits
(b) fixed deposits, and
(c) saving deposits

* **(a) Demand deposits:** Demand deposits (also known as current account deposits) are those deposits which are repayable by banks on demand. These are chequable deposits. These can be withdrawn by any number of times. No interest is paid on such deposits. These deposits are made by businessmen to carry out their day to day transactions.
* **(b) Fixed deposits (or Time deposits):** Fixed deposits are those deposits which can be withdrawn only after the expiry of certain fixed period, say a few months or a few years. Fixed deposits are maintained both by firms and households. The rate of interest offered on such deposits depends on the time period. The longer the period, the higher will be the interest rate. No cheque facility is available on these deposits.
* **(c) Saving account deposits:** Saving account deposits have the features of both demand deposits and saving deposits. Cheque facility is provided to the depositors. But some restrictions are imposed on number and amount of withdrawals. Hence, banks offer interest on these accounts but less than that on fixed deposits.

It should be noted that current deposits and some proportion of saving deposits are called chequable deposits (or demand deposits) whereas fixed deposits are non-chequable.

**Demand Deposits vs Time Deposits**

| Basis                          | Demand Deposits                             | Time Deposits                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Payable** | They are payable on demand.                 | These are deposits for a fixed period of time. |
| **2. Interest on deposits** | No interest is given on these deposits.     | High rate of interest is given on deposits.    |
| **3. Restrictions on withdrawal** | There is no restriction on their withdrawals. | There are restrictions on their withdrawals.   |
| **4. Cheque Facility** | They can be withdrawn by cheques.           | They are not chequable deposits.               |
| **5. Medium of Exchange** | They are used as medium of exchange.        | They can not be used as medium of exchange.    |

**(2) Advancing loans:** Giving loans is another primary function of the commercial banks. They advance loans and earn interest income. Banks give loans mostly for productive purposes against collateral securities. The amount of loan is generally less than the value of the security offered. Banks advance following types of loans:
* **(a) Cash credit:** Under this loan, a credit limit is sanctioned by the bank. The borrower may withdraw any amount within this sanctioned limit. The borrower is charged interest only on the amount of money that has been actually drawn and not on the amount that has been sanctioned.
* **(b) Demand loans:** Demand loans refer to those loans which can be recalled on demand by the bank at any time. The entire sum of demand loan is credited to the borrower's account and interest is payable on the entire amount.
* **(c) Short term loans:** They are given as personal loans against some collateral security. The money is credited to the account of borrower and the borrower can withdraw money from his account and interest is payable on the entire amount of loan granted.

#### 1.3 Money (or Credit) Creation by Commercial Banks
Money creation is one of the most important functions of commercial banks. Commercial banks are an important source of money supply in an economy. They add to money supply by creating demand deposits. Money creation is the process of expansion of credit through derivative deposits. It is also known as 'Deposit creation' and 'Credit creation'.

Money creation by banks is determined by:
(i) The amount of initial deposits or primary deposits
(ii) The Legal Reserve Ratio (LRR)

LRR is the minimum ratio of deposits legally required by the commercial bank to be kept as cash.

**Process of money (credit) creation:**
The process of money creation by banks can be illustrated with the help of an example. Suppose that all banks receive initial cash deposits of ₹1,000 and LRR is 10%. It means banks are required to keep only 10% of deposits (i.e., ₹100) and lend the remaining amount of ₹900. Banks do not give loans in cash rather open an account in the borrower's name and deposit the loan amount in his account. The borrower is free to withdraw the amount as and when they wish. This kind of deposit is called secondary deposit or derivative deposit.
Suppose, borrowers withdraw the entire amount of loan and spend or make payments of goods and services received. The sellers of these goods and services receive it as revenue and deposit the same in their respective banks. It will increase the demand deposits of banks by ₹900. They keep 10% of these new deposits i.e., ₹90 as cash reserve and lend the remaining amount of ₹810. The borrowers will again use their loans for making payments which again comes back into the accounts of those who have received these payments. Banks again will keep 10% of ₹810 and lend the remaining amount of ₹729 (810-81). Like this in each successive round creation of deposits will be 90% of previous round. In each round, increase in deposits becomes smaller and smaller till it becomes almost zero. The total deposits will ultimately be of ₹10,000 which is 10 times the initial deposits of ₹1,000.

| Round           | Deposits (₹) | Cash Reserves (LRR=10%) (₹) | Loans (₹) |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- | --------- |
| Initial Deposits| 1000         | 100                         | 900       |
| First Round     | 900          | 90                          | 810       |
| Second Round    | 810          | 81                          | 729       |
| ...             | ...          | ...                         | ...       |
| **Total** | **10,000** | **1,000** | **9,000** |

From the example, we observe that the initial cash deposits were just ₹1000. Banks are able to create total deposits of ₹10,000 which are 10 times of the initial deposits. Ten times is nothing but the value of money multiplier.

Money (or credit) Multiplier = 1 / LRR = 1 / 0.10 = 10
Total demand deposits = Money Multiplier × Cash Reserves
= 10 × 1000 = ₹10,000

**Assumptions:**
(i) All the depositors do not approach the banks for withdrawal of cash at the same time and also they do not withdraw their entire amount.
(ii) All receipts and payments in the economy are made through banks. In other words, all receipts are deposited in banks and all payments are made through cheques.

### 2. Central Bank

#### 2.1 Meaning of Central Bank
Central bank is an apex (supreme) institution in the banking and financial structure of a country. It is the leader of the money market. It supervises, regulates and controls the whole banking and financial system. It is called central bank because it occupies a central position in the monetary and banking structure of the country.
> "Central bank is an apex bank of the monetary and banking structure of a country. It controls the supply of money and credit in the country".

Almost all the countries in the world have their central banks. Reserve Bank of India is the central bank of India which was established on April 1, 1935. The Bank of England was the first to function as a central bank in 1844. Federal Reserve System operates as the Central Bank of USA.

#### 2.2 Distinction Between a Central Bank and Commercial Banks

| Basis             | Central Bank                                                                                      | Commercial Banks                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Nature**     | Central bank is a supreme institution of the monetary and banking structure.                      | Commercial banks deal in money and credit for earning profit.     |
| **2. Object**     | It acts in the public interest.                                                                   | Their main objective is to earn profits.                          |
| **3. Note-Issue** | It has sole monopoly over note-issue.                                                             | Commercial banks have no legal power to issue notes.              |
| **4. Ownership**  | It is generally a government owned institution.                                                   | Commercial banks may operate in private as well as public sector. |
| **5. Number**     | There is only one central bank in a country.                                                      | There are a number of commercial banks in every country.          |
| **6. Banker**     | It is a banker of the government and commercial banks. It does not directly deal with the public. | Commercial banks directly deal with the public.                   |

#### 2.3 Functions of a Central Bank

**1. Issue of currency:** The central bank enjoys the sole legal right to issue currency notes. The currency so created is called 'high powered money'. That is why it is called 'Bank of Issue'. These notes circulate throughout the country as legal tender money. Like any other central bank, the RBI has the sole right to issue currency notes. Following are the main reasons for giving the monopoly right of note-issue to the central bank.
(i) It brings about uniformity in note circulation.
(ii) It is easier to control credit when there is a single agency of note issue.
(iii) It keeps the public faith in the paper currency.
(iv) It helps in the stabilization of the internal and external value of the currency.

**2. Banker, Agent and Advisor to the Government:**
* **(a) Banker:** As a banker to the government, it manages the banking accounts of government departments. It performs the same banking functions for the government as commercial bank performs for its customers. It accepts deposits and makes payment for the government. It also gives short period loans to the government.
* **(b) Agent:** As an agent to the government, it buys and sells securities, treasury bills on behalf of the government. It also manages public debt.
* **(c) Advisor:** Central bank gives advice to the government on economic and financial matters such as deficit financing, devaluation of currency, foreign trade policy, foreign exchange policy etc.

**3. Banker to the Banks:** The central bank has the same relationship with the commercial banks as the latter has with the general public. Commercial banks are required to keep a part of their deposits with the central bank in the form of cash. The central bank is the custodian of the cash reserves of the commercial banks.
(i) The central bank uses these reserves to meet the cash requirements of individual commercial banks.
(ii) The central bank supervises, regulates and controls the commercial banks. The supervision of banks may be related to their licensing, branch expansion, management, amalgamation (merging of banks) and liquidation (the winding up of banks).

**What is "Custodian"?**
A custodian means a guardian or keeper - someone who is responsible for looking after and managing something valuable on behalf of others. So, when we say:
* Central bank is the custodian of cash reserves → it keeps the reserves of all banks safely.
* Central bank is the custodian of foreign exchange reserves → it keeps and manages the nation's foreign currencies and gold.

**4. Lender of the Last Resort:** The central bank acts as a lender of the last resort. When a commercial bank fails to meet the obligations of its depositors from all its sources, it can finally approach the central bank. The central bank comes to its rescue and gives loans as lender of the last resort. Central bank gives loans to these banks against the approved securities and bills of exchange. However, commercial banks are supposed to approach other sources first like the call money market and should then only approach the Central bank. That is why, central bank is called the lender of the last resort.

**5. Clearing House Function:** As the custodian of the cash reserves of the commercial banks, the central bank acts as the clearing house for these banks. Since all banks have their accounts with the central bank, the central bank can easily settle the claims of various banks against each other simply by book entries of transfers from and to their accounts. This method of settling accounts is called clearing house function of the central bank. The significance of this function is that it economises the use of money in the banking operations.

**6. Custodian of Nation's Foreign Exchange Reserves:** Central bank is the custodian of nation's foreign exchange reserves. The central bank maintains foreign exchange reserves in order to promote international trade and stabilise exchange rate.

# Tools of Monetary Policy

### 1. Quantitative Methods
Quantitative methods affect the volume of credit in the economy. These methods include the following:

**(a) Bank Rate**
The bank rate is the traditional method of credit control used by a central bank. It is the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks or rediscounts approved first-class bills of exchange and government securities held by the commercial banks. Changes in the bank rate affect the money supply in the economy. The bank rate specifically refers to the interest rate at which a country's central bank lends money to member banks for a long period as a lender of the last resort.
#### Increase in Bank Rate
During inflation (a state of rising prices), the central bank raises its bank rate to control the volume of credit. This increases the cost of borrowing for commercial banks. An increase in the bank rate causes commercial banks to raise their own lending interest rates. This, in turn, discourages businesses and others from borrowing, leading to a reduction in the volume of credit and the money supply.
#### Decrease in Bank Rate
During deflation (a state of falling prices), the central bank reduces the bank rate. This makes borrowing from the central bank cheaper for commercial banks, which then also reduce their lending rates. Businessmen are encouraged to borrow more, which leads to an expansion of credit and the money supply. Consequently, output, employment, income, and aggregate demand begin to rise.

> **Box 6.1: Bank Rate, Repo Rate and Reverse Repo Rate**
> * **Bank Rate:** Bank rate refers to the rate of interest at which country's central bank lends money to member banks for a long period as a lender of the last resort.
> * **Repo rate:** Repo rate (short form of re-purchase option) refers to the market rate of interest at which central bank lends money to banks for short period. Commercial banks get loans from central bank by selling securities to the latter. However, this is a conditional loan. The condition is that banks will repurchase their securities after a fixed time period at a pre-determined price. There is no such condition in case of bank rate. The RBI has replaced bank rate with repo rate to influence the availability of credit and rate of interest in the country.
> * **Reverse Repo Rate:** Reverse repo rate is the rate of interest at which the RBI borrows from commercial banks for short period. This is done by selling government bonds to banks. The banks utilise the reverse repo rate facility to deposit their short term excess funds with the RBI and earn interest on it.

**(b) Open market operations (OMO):** Open market operations refer to the buying and selling of government securities (like National Saving Certificates (NSCs)) by the central bank from/to the public and banks. OMO are used to influence money supply in the country.
* **Sale of Securities:** During the period of excess demand or inflation, the central bank starts selling government securities. As a result, the cash resources of commercial banks are reduced and they are not in position to lend more. This reduces the volume of credit and money supply.
* **Purchase of Securities:** During deficient demand or deflation, the central bank starts purchasing securities. This increases the cash reserves of commercial banks, increasing their lending capacity.

**(c) Cash reserve ratio (CRR):** It refers to the minimum percentage of total demand and time deposits to be kept by commercial banks with the central bank.
* **Increase in CRR:** An increase in CRR reduces the excess reserves of commercial banks and limits their lending power. CRR is raised during inflation.
* **Decrease in CRR:** During deflation, the central bank decreases the CRR. A decrease in CRR increases the banks' excess reserves and thus increases their lending ability.

**(d) Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR):** It refers to the minimum percentage of net demand and time deposits which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves in the form of cash or other liquid assets.
* **Increase in SLR:** The central bank increases the SLR during inflation. This reduces the amount of excess reserves of the banks and their lending ability.
* **Decrease in SLR:** The central bank reduces the SLR during deflation. A decrease in the SLR increases excess reserves of the banks and their ability to give credit.

excess reserves - money for lending
### 2. Qualitative Methods

These methods direct or restrict the flow of credit to specific areas of economic activities.

**(a) Regulation of consumer's credit:** Under this method, the credit given to durable consumer goods is controlled. Durable consumer goods (like motor cars, houses, computers etc.) are purchased under 'Hire Purchase System'.

**(d) Moral suasion:** Under this method, the central bank adopts the policy of persuasion and pressure on the commercial banks in order to get them to fall in line with its policy. The central bank frequently announces its policy and urges the commercial banks to adopt it. This is exercised through letters, discussions and directives to the banks.

# Foreign Exchange
### Types of Exchange Rate Systems

Exchange rates determine the value of a country’s currency in terms of foreign currencies. Broadly, exchange rate systems can be classified as **Fixed**, **Flexible (Floating)**, and **Managed Floating**.

#### A. Fixed Exchange Rate System
- **Definition:** A system in which the exchange rate is officially **pegged or fixed** by the government in terms of gold or another currency.  
- **Advantages:**  
  1. Helps coordinate economic policies among countries in an interdependent global economy.  
  2. Prevents major economic distortions in member countries.  
  3. Encourages expansion of international trade by reducing risk and uncertainty in transactions.  
- **Drawbacks:**  
  - Requires large foreign currency or gold reserves.  
  - Restricts independent monetary policy.  
  - Vulnerable to speculative attacks.  
- **Note:** Due to these limitations, many economists prefer **flexible exchange rate systems**.
#### B. Flexible (Floating) Exchange Rate System
- **Definition:** A system in which the value of a currency **fluctuates freely** based on **demand and supply** in the foreign exchange market.  
- **Advantages:**  
  1. Eliminates the need for central banks to hold large international reserves.  
  2. Helps remove barriers to trade and capital movements.  
#### C. Managed Floating System
- **Definition:** A hybrid system combining fixed and flexible exchange rates.  
- The **central bank intervenes** to limit extreme fluctuations but the rate is largely determined by **market forces**.  
- **Purpose:** Provides stability while allowing some flexibility in currency valuation.

## Sources of Demand for Foreign Exchange

Demand for foreign exchange arises when individuals or businesses need foreign currency for various purposes:  
1. Purchase of goods and services from abroad.  
2. Investment in foreign financial assets (bonds, equities).  
3. Direct investment in foreign businesses, factories, or property.  
4. Speculation on the value of foreign currencies.  
5. Sending gifts abroad.  
6. Travel and remittances by foreign workers.

## Sources of Supply of Foreign Exchange

Supply arises when foreign currency flows **into the domestic economy**, such as:  
1. Export of goods and services to foreign countries.  
2. Foreign investments in domestic bonds and equity.  
3. Currency dealers and speculators bringing foreign currency.  
4. Remittances sent by domestic workers from abroad.  
5. Foreign tourism spending in the country.

## Determination of Exchange Rate

In a **freely floating market**, the exchange rate is determined by **demand and supply of foreign currency**.  

- **Equilibrium Exchange Rate:** Occurs where **demand = supply**.  
- **Graphical Representation:**  
  - The intersection of the **demand curve (D)** and **supply curve (S)** determines the **equilibrium exchange rate (OR)** and **equilibrium quantity (OQ)**.

### Changes in Exchange Rate

1. **Increase in demand for US dollars (from India):**  
   - The **demand curve shifts right** (D → D1).  
   - Exchange rate rises (OR → OR1), indicating **depreciation of the Indian rupee** (more rupees needed per dollar).  

2. **Increase in supply of US dollars (from India):**  
   - The **supply curve shifts right** (S → S1).  
   - Exchange rate falls (OR → OR1), indicating **appreciation of the Indian rupee** (fewer rupees needed per dollar).  

### Key Concepts in Foreign Exchange

**Depreciation of Money (Currency Depreciation)**
Depreciation of money means a fall in the value of a country's currency in terms of foreign currencies under a floating exchange rate system. It happens due to market forces (demand and supply of currency).
* Example: If earlier 1 USD = ₹80, but now 1 USD = ₹85, then the rupee has depreciated.

**Causes of Currency Depreciation:**
* High imports and low exports (trade deficit).
* Inflation in the domestic economy.
* High demand for foreign currency.
* Capital outflow (investors pulling money out).

**Opposite of Depreciation = Appreciation of Money (Currency Appreciation)**
Appreciation means an increase in the value of a currency against foreign currencies.
* Example: If earlier 1 USD = ₹80, but now 1 USD = ₹75, then the rupee has appreciated.

**Devaluation and Revaluation:**
* **Devaluation** means reduction in the external value of domestic currency by the government.
* **Revaluation** denotes an increase in the external value of domestic currency by the government.

**Foreign Exchange Market:**
Refers to the market in which national currencies are traded for one another. The major participants are commercial banks, foreign exchange brokers, other authorized dealers and the monetary authorities.
**Functions:**
* **Transfer function:** It transfers purchasing power between countries.
* **Credit function:** It provides credit for foreign trade, often through bills of exchange.
* **Hedging function:** When exporters and importers enter into an agreement to sell and buy goods on some future date at an exchange rate agreed upon today.

### Tax and Subsidy

**TAX**
Tax is a compulsory contribution by citizens to the government exchequer. Tax is different from fees. Tax paid by rich persons and government facilities as government schools and hospitals are used by the poor.

**Types of taxes:**
**1. Based on Burden of Tax**
* **(a) Direct Tax:** Tax is paid directly by the person on whom it is imposed. Burden cannot be shifted. Example: Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Property Tax.
* **(b) Indirect Tax:** Tax is imposed on one person but the burden is shifted to others. Example: GST, Customs Duty, Excise Duty. The burden on the consumer depends on the price elasticity of demand and supply.

**2. Based on rate of taxation**
* **Proportional tax:** Rate of tax remains the same irrespective of the size of income.
* **Progressive tax:** Rate of tax increases with an increase in the size of income. Income tax in India is an example.

**Value Added Tax (VAT)**
A type of sales tax imposed on the value added at each stage of production and distribution. It helps avoid the cascading effect (tax on tax). Launched in India in 2005 and later replaced by GST in 2017.

**Excise Duty vs Customs Duty**
* **Excise Duty:** tax on goods produced within the country.
* **Customs Duty:** tax on goods imported from foreign countries.

**Subsidy**
A subsidy is financial support given by the government to an industry to reduce the cost of production, so that the selling price can be kept lower.
**Purpose:**
1.  Help poor people (e.g., food subsidy).
2.  Encourage eco-friendly products (e.g., subsidy on CNG).
3.  Counter foreign trade policies and remain competitive.

### Monetary and Fiscal Policy

**1. Monetary Policy**
* **Controlled by:** Central Bank (e.g., RBI in India).
* **Meaning:** Policy related to money supply, interest rates, and credit flow.
* **Objective:** Control inflation, stabilize currency, promote growth.
* **Tools:**
    * **Quantitative:** CRR, SLR, Repo rate, Reverse Repo rate, Open Market Operations.
    * **Qualitative:** Credit rationing, margin requirements, moral suasion.

**2. Fiscal Policy**
* **Controlled by:** Government (Ministry of Finance).
* **Meaning:** Policy related to government's revenue (taxation) and expenditure (spending & subsidies).
* **Objective:** Control inflation/deflation, reduce unemployment, promote growth.
* **Tools:** Taxes, Expenditure, Deficit Financing.

### International Trade Concepts

**Dumping**
A practice where a country exports a product at a price lower than its cost of production or below its domestic market price. It is considered an unfair trade practice.
**Types:**
* **Predatory Dumping:** Selling cheaply to eliminate local competitors, then raising prices.
* **Persistent Dumping:** Regularly selling at lower prices abroad to maintain market share.
* **Sporadic Dumping:** Occasional sale of surplus goods at very low prices abroad.
* **Reverse Dumping:** Selling at higher prices abroad than at home.

**Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)**
Legal rights given to creators or inventors to protect their intellectual creations (ideas, inventions, artistic works, brands).
**Types:**
* Copyrights (for books, music, software)
* Patents (for inventions)
* Trademarks (for brand names, logos)
* Industrial Designs (for product designs)
* Geographical Indications (GI Tags) (e.g., Darjeeling Tea)
* Trade Secrets (e.g., Coca-Cola formula)

**WTO (World Trade Organization)**
An international organization established in 1995 that deals with the rules of trade between nations.
**Functions:**
* Promotes free trade by reducing barriers.
* Settles trade disputes.
* Monitors trade policies.
* Provides a platform for trade negotiations.
The WTO's **TRIPS** (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement sets minimum standards for protecting IPR across member countries.

**Free Trade vs Protectionism**
* **Free Trade:** International trade without restrictions like tariffs or quotas. Based on comparative advantage.
* **Protectionism:** Government policies that restrict imports to protect domestic industries. Common tools include tariffs, quotas, and subsidies.

**Tariffs and Barriers**
* **Tariff:** A tax on trade, most commonly on imports. Used to protect domestic industries, generate revenue, or for political reasons.
* **Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs):** Other methods to make trade difficult, such as:
    * Import Quotas (limit on quantity)
    * Embargoes (complete ban)
    * Licensing requirements
    * Subsidies to domestic producers
    * Technical/Health regulations
    * Voluntary Export Restraints (VERs)

### Balance of Payment (BoP)

A Balance of Payment account is a statement of double entry system of all economic transactions between residents of a Country and the rest of the world carried out in a specified period (financial year).
These monetary transactions arise due to:
(I) Transaction in goods (merchandise or visible items).
(II) Transaction in services (invisible items).
(III) Transaction in Capital (loans, deposits, investment etc.).
Inflow of foreign exchange constitutes the Credit Side. Outflow constitutes the Debit Side.

**Components of Balance of Payment:**
1.  Balance of Payment on Current A/c
2.  Balance of Payment on Capital A/c

**1. Current Account**
Deals with day-to-day transactions of goods, services, income, and transfers.
**Components:**
1.  **Trade in Goods (Merchandise Trade):** Exports and Imports of physical goods.
2.  **Trade in Services (Invisibles):** Exports and imports of services like banking, insurance, tourism, IT.
3.  **Income:** Earnings from investment (interest, dividends, profits).
4.  **Current Transfers (Unilateral transfers):** One-way transfers with no quid pro quo. Example: Remittances, gifts, grants, donations.

**2. Capital Account**
Deals with financial transactions that change assets or liabilities of a country.
**Components:**
1.  **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):** Foreign companies setting up factories or buying stakes in domestic companies.
2.  **Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI):** Foreigners buying shares, bonds, etc., in domestic stock markets.
3.  **External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs):** Loans taken by domestic companies/government from abroad.
4.  **Banking Capital & Reserves:** Changes in foreign exchange reserves of the central bank.

### Balance of Trade (BoT)

The difference between the value of a country's exports and imports of *goods* only. It is a part of the Current Account.
`BoT = Value of Exports of Goods - Value of Imports of Goods`
* **Favourable (Surplus) BoT:** Exports > Imports
* **Unfavourable (Deficit) BoT:** Imports > Exports
* **Balanced BoT:** Exports = Imports

**BoT vs BoP**

| Basis         | Balance of Trade (BoT)         | Balance of Payments (BoP)                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Coverage**  | Only goods (exports & imports) | Goods + services + transfers + investments    |
| **Concept**   | Narrow concept                 | Broader concept                               |
| **Indicator** | Shows trade surplus/deficit    | Shows overall international economic position |
