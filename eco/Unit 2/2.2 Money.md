### 1. Barter System of Exchange

#### 1.1 Meaning of Barter Exchange
 Barter means exchange of goods for goods. An economy, where there is a direct barter of goods and services, is called a 'Barter Economy' or 'C - C Economy' (where C - C stands for commodity to commodity).

#### Difficulties of Barter System
Bayer system of exchange suffers from the following drawbacks.

**(1) Lack of double coincidence of wants:** The barter system requires a double coincidence of wants on the part of those who want to exchange goods or services. For example, suppose a farmer possesses wheat and wants to exchange it for cloth. In the barter system, he has to find out a person who not only has cloth but also wants wheat in return. But, such a double coincidence is a rare possibility. Imagine how much effort (physical labour) it will require to find such a person. Moreover, it also involves waiting for the appropriate person. Waiting involves discomforts which implies disutility. Efforts and disutility of discomforts taken together is called trading cost of barter exchange.

**(2) Lack of common measure of value:** Another difficulty of barter is that at what rate any exchange is to be made. There is lack of common measure of value. For example, if there are 1000 goods in the market then the value of each would have to be expressed in terms of 999 goods. The price list then becomes extremely complicated. Not only this, no proper accounting is possible in the absence of common unit of value.

**(3) Problem of future payments:** Thirdly, the barter system lacks a standard of deferred payments. In the absence of money, future payments are not possible because of the following reasons:
(a) The borrower may not be able to arrange exactly the same good and of the same quality at the time of repayment.
(b) There could be disagreement regarding which specific commodity would be used for repayment.
(c) There exists a risk since the commodity may increase or decrease in its value at the time of repayment.

**(4) Problem of storing of value:** Lastly, the barter system does not provide a reliable method of storing value or wealth for future use. Storing of value means storing of the purchasing power i.e., storing of income for future use. Under barter system, it is difficult for people to store wealth for future use. Most of the goods like wheat, rice, vegetables etc. do not possess durability and their quality deteriorates with passage of time. Further, storage of goods require time, money and efforts. It makes their storage very difficult. As a result, goods cannot be used to store wealth for future use.

Due to these above mentioned drawbacks of the barter system, the process of exchange becomes highly inefficient. To overcome these difficulties, money was invented by the society.

### 2. Meaning of Money
Basically, money was introduced as an instrument (or medium) of exchange. Accordingly, money meant anything that act as medium of exchange. With the passage of time, money came to be defined differently. The important definitions of money are explained under the following heads:

**(Diagram: Definition of Money)**
* **Legal Definition:** Anything declared by the government as money is called money.
* **Functional Definition:** Anything that is generally acceptable as a medium of exchange and at the same time acts as a measure and as store of value.
* **Narrow & Broad Definition:**
    * **Narrow Definition:** Money consists of those things only which are used as medium of exchange.
    * **Broad Definition:** Money consists of those things which are used as medium of exchange and also those things which have high degree of moneyness.

#### Legal definition of money
According to this definition, ***money is what the law says is money***. In other words, any thing the government declares it as money is money. A thing will have general acceptability if the law declares it as money. Since it has the legal power to discharge debts, no creditor can refuse it or he may not demand anything else in payment of debt. Currency-notes and coins are legal tender money. It is also called fiat money because it serves as money on the fiat (order) of the government.

#### 2.2 Functional definition of money
 'anything that is generally acceptable as a medium of exchange and at the same time acts as a measure and as store of value'. This is an ideal definition of money because of two reasons:
(i) This definition emphasizes all the important functions of money.
(ii) It stresses upon the basic characteristic of general acceptability.

#### 2.3 Narrow and broad definitions of money
On the basis of scope, money has been defined in two ways: (i) narrow money and (ii) broad money.
Narrow money includes only currency notes and coins. It includes only those things which function as medium of exchange. On the other hand, broad money, besides including notes and coins, also includes some other things in the supply of money that have a high degree of moneyness e.g., time deposits at banks and post offices. These can be converted into ready cash at short notice.

### 3. Classification of Money
Money can be classified as under:
#### 3.1 Full Bodied Money

Full bodied money is that money whose value as a commodity is equal to its value as money. It is also called standard money. When the economies of the world were on gold standard or silver standard, gold coins or silver coins were full bodied money. A rupee coin during the British period in India was made of silver. Its commodity value (i.e., metallic value or intrinsic value) was equal to its money value (i.e., face value).

commodity value = face value
#### 3.2 Credit Money

Credit money refers to that money whose value as money is greater than its commodity value (i.e., value of the material from which it is made). It means face value is greater than intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is the value of the material (metal etc.) contained in the unit of money. Credit money includes the following:
(a) **Token Coins:** (Coins of ₹10, 5, 2, 1 in India are all token coins) since their value as money is far above than the value of metal used in them.
(b) **Circulating Promissory Notes:** Paper notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India (e.g., currency notes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000) fall under this category. We find written on the note, 'I promise to pay the bearer the sum of rupees' signed by the Governor of RBI. Any note is just a piece of paper with a promise on it. These words do not imply its convertibility into gold or silver. Its commodity value is virtually nothing and hence it is credit money.

face value > commodity value
#### 3.3 Legal Tender Money and Optional Money

**(a) Legal Tender Money:** Money which can be legally used to make payment of debt or other obligations is termed as legal tender money. It is also called fiat money as runs by the authority of the government. Currency notes and coins are therefore, called legal tender money. A creditor is obliged by law to accept such money. Legal tender money is of two kinds:

(i) **Limited Legal Tender:** It refers to that form of legal tender money which can be paid in discharge of a debt upto a certain limit. Beyond this limit, a person may refuse to accept the payment and no legal action can be taken against him. In India, coins are limited legal tender.

(ii) **Unlimited Legal Tender**: It refers to that form of legal tender money which can be paid upto any extent. A person has to accept without any maximum limit. Legal action can be taken against a person who refuses to accept this money. In India, paper notes are unlimited legal tender.

**(b) Optional Money:** It refers to that form of money which is generally accepted as medium of exchange, but legally, there is no compulsion to accept it. For example, cheques, bank drafts etc. do not have legal boundation. One may accept or refuse them. It is also called fiduciary money as it is accepted as money on the basis of trust between the payer and payee.

#### 3.4 Bank Money

Bank money refers to the demand deposits of the people at banks. These deposits are payable on demand. Bank money facilitates the exact amount of payments through cheques, drafts etc. It is also called deposit money. Bank money is optional. A person may or may not accept the payment through cheque or draft etc.

### 4. Functions of Money
Money performs several important functions. These functions are classified into two categories:
(1) Primary functions and
(2) Secondary functions

### 5. Supply of Money

#### 5.1 Meaning of Supply of Money
Supply of money is defined as the total stock of all the forms of money (paper money, coins and demand deposits at banks) which are held by the public on a specific day. The term public implies the people using money in carrying out their transactions. In it government and banking system are not included as they are creators (or producers) of money.

**Two Features of Supply of Money:**
(i) **Stock variable:** Supply of money is a stock variable because it is related to a point of time.
(ii) **Money held by the public:** Supply of money always refers to the stock of money held by the public. The stock of money with government, Reserve Bank of India and banking system is not included in supply of money as it does not come into circulation in the country. Supply of money includes that money which belongs to the public for use to carry out transactions.

#### 5.2 Components of Supply of Money
Money supply is composed of the following two elements:
(a) Currency with the public
(b) Demand deposits at banks

**(a) Currency with the public:** Currency with the public include following items:
(i) Currency notes in circulation issued by the Reserve Bank of India.
(ii) Small coins in circulation.

**(b) Demand deposits at banks:** Demand deposits are another important component of money supply. As mentioned earlier, demand deposits with banks are also called bank money. Demand deposits in the banks refer to those deposits which are payable on demand. These are the deposits on which cheques can be written. Through cheques these deposits can be transferred to others for making payments from whom goods and services have been purchased. Thus, cheques make these demand deposits as a medium of exchange and therefore, make them to serve as money.

Note that inter-bank deposits do not constitute part of money supply as they do not belong to the public. Only net demand deposits of commercial banks are included in money supply. The word 'net' here implies only the deposits of public held by banks.

Thus, money supply (M) is composed of currency held by the public (C) and demand deposits with banks (DD).
In short, `M = C + DD`

#### 5.3 Measures of money supply
![[Pasted image 20250923021639.png]]
The Reserve Bank of India has given four measures of money supply viz, M₁, M₂, M₃ and M₄. They are defined as follows:

* **M₁**
    `M₁ = C + DD + OD`
    C is currency held by the public. DD is the demand deposits of people in bank. OD (other deposits) are the demand deposits held by the RBI of Public Financial Institutions (like IDBI), foreign central banks and foreign governments, international financial institutions like IMF. Deposits of government and banks are not included in these other deposits.
    M₁ is the most liquid measure of money supply as all its components are easily used as medium of exchange.

* **M₂**
    It is a broader concept of money supply compared to M₁. Besides M₁, it also includes saving deposits with post offices.
    `M₂ = M₁ + savings deposits with post offices`

* **M₃**
    It is a broader concept. Besides M₁, it also includes net time deposits at banks.
    `M₃ = M₁ + net time deposits of commercial banks`

* **M₄**
    Besides M₃, it includes total deposits with post offices.
    `M₄ = M₃ + total deposits with post offices (excluding National Savings Certificates).`

M₁ and M₂ are called narrow money while M₃ and M₄ are called broad money. This classification is based on the quality of liquidity. Among all the four measures, M₁ is the most liquid while M₄ is the least liquid. By liquidity we mean the conversion of an asset into cash easily and quickly without loss of value. M₃ measure of money supply is known as aggregate monetary resources of the country.

### Simplified Definitions

**1. Narrow Money (M1)**
The most liquid forms of money - meaning they can be used for transactions immediately.
It usually includes:
* Currency in circulation (notes + coins with the public)
* Demand deposits with banks (current + savings accounts that can be withdrawn anytime)
* Other deposits with the central bank (from government/public bodies, if included in a country's definition)
**Key point:** Narrow money = money you can spend right now.

**2. Broad Money (M3)**
A wider measure of money supply. It includes M1 plus less liquid forms of money.
It usually includes:
* M1 (narrow money)
* Time deposits with banks (fixed deposits, recurring deposits, term deposits)
**Key point:** Broad money = M1 + money kept in the bank for longer periods (less liquid, but still part of money supply).
