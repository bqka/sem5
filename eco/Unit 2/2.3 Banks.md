### 1. Commercial Banks

#### 1.1 Meaning of Commercial Bank
A commercial bank is a financial institution which accepts deposits from the public and gives loans for purposes of consumption and investment.
> "A Banking Company is one which transacts the business of banking which means the accepting for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise and withdrawable by cheque, draft or otherwise." - Banking Companies Act 1949

There are two essential functions that a financial institution must perform to be a commercial bank. These are:
(a) Acceptance of demand deposits that have cheque facilities.
(b) Lending

Acceptance of chequable deposits is necessary, but not sufficient condition for a financial institution to become a commercial bank. For example, post-office savings banks are not banks even though they accept chequable deposits from the public. This is because they do not perform the function of lending. In other words, they do not create demand deposits which are a part of money supply. Similarly, lending alone does not make any financial institution a bank. For example, LIC of India, etc., give loan but they do not accept chequable deposits from the public. These financial institutions also do not create money and hence cannot be called banks.

#### 1.2 Functions of Commercial Banks
Accepting deposits and lending money are the two primary functions of commercial banks.

**(1) Accepting deposits:** The primary function of every commercial bank is to accept deposits from the public. To attract savings, the banks accept mainly three types of deposits:
(a) demand deposits
(b) fixed deposits, and
(c) saving deposits

* **(a) Demand deposits:** Demand deposits (also known as current account deposits) are those deposits which are repayable by banks on demand. These are chequable deposits. These can be withdrawn by any number of times. No interest is paid on such deposits. These deposits are made by businessmen to carry out their day to day transactions.
* **(b) Fixed deposits (or Time deposits):** Fixed deposits are those deposits which can be withdrawn only after the expiry of certain fixed period, say a few months or a few years. Fixed deposits are maintained both by firms and households. The rate of interest offered on such deposits depends on the time period. The longer the period, the higher will be the interest rate. No cheque facility is available on these deposits.
* **(c) Saving account deposits:** Saving account deposits have the features of both demand deposits and fixed deposits. Cheque facility is provided to the depositors. But some restrictions are imposed on number and amount of withdrawals. Hence, banks offer interest on these accounts but less than that on fixed deposits.

It should be noted that current deposits and some proportion of saving deposits are called chequable deposits (or demand deposits) whereas fixed deposits are non-chequable.

**Demand Deposits vs Time Deposits**

| Basis                          | Demand Deposits                             | Time Deposits                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Payable** | They are payable on demand.                 | These are deposits for a fixed period of time. |
| **2. Interest on deposits** | No interest is given on these deposits.     | High rate of interest is given on deposits.    |
| **3. Restrictions on withdrawal** | There is no restriction on their withdrawals. | There are restrictions on their withdrawals.   |
| **4. Cheque Facility** | They can be withdrawn by cheques.           | They are not chequable deposits.               |
| **5. Medium of Exchange** | They are used as medium of exchange.        | They can not be used as medium of exchange.    |

**(2) Advancing loans:** Giving loans is another primary function of the commercial banks. They advance loans and earn interest income. Banks give loans mostly for productive purposes against collateral securities. The amount of loan is generally less than the value of the security offered. Banks advance following types of loans:
* **(a) Cash credit:** Under this loan, a credit limit is sanctioned by the bank. The borrower may withdraw any amount within this sanctioned limit. The borrower is charged interest only on the amount of money that has been actually drawn and not on the amount that has been sanctioned.
* **(b) Demand loans:** Demand loans refer to those loans which can be recalled on demand by the bank at any time. The entire sum of demand loan is credited to the borrower's account and interest is payable on the entire amount.
* **(c) Short term loans:** They are given as personal loans against some collateral security. The money is credited to the account of borrower and the borrower can withdraw money from his account and interest is payable on the entire amount of loan granted.

#### 1.3 Money (or Credit) Creation by Commercial Banks
Money creation is one of the most important functions of commercial banks. Commercial banks are an important source of money supply in an economy. They add to money supply by creating demand deposits. Money creation is the process of expansion of credit through derivative deposits. It is also known as 'Deposit creation' and 'Credit creation'.

Money creation by banks is determined by:
(i) The amount of initial deposits or primary deposits
(ii) The Legal Reserve Ratio (LRR)

LRR is the minimum ratio of deposits legally required by the commercial bank to be kept as cash.

**Process of money (credit) creation:**
The process of money creation by banks can be illustrated with the help of an example. Suppose that all banks receive initial cash deposits of ₹1,000 and LRR is 10%. It means banks are required to keep only 10% of deposits (i.e., ₹100) and lend the remaining amount of ₹900. Banks do not give loans in cash rather open an account in the borrower's name and deposit the loan amount in his account. The borrower is free to withdraw the amount as and when they wish. This kind of deposit is called secondary deposit or derivative deposit.
Suppose, borrowers withdraw the entire amount of loan and spend or make payments of goods and services received. The sellers of these goods and services receive it as revenue and deposit the same in their respective banks. It will increase the demand deposits of banks by ₹900. They keep 10% of these new deposits i.e., ₹90 as cash reserve and lend the remaining amount of ₹810. The borrowers will again use their loans for making payments which again comes back into the accounts of those who have received these payments. Banks again will keep 10% of ₹810 and lend the remaining amount of ₹729 (810-81). Like this in each successive round creation of deposits will be 90% of previous round. In each round, increase in deposits becomes smaller and smaller till it becomes almost zero. The total deposits will ultimately be of ₹10,000 which is 10 times the initial deposits of ₹1,000.

| Round           | Deposits (₹) | Cash Reserves (LRR=10%) (₹) | Loans (₹) |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- | --------- |
| Initial Deposits| 1000         | 100                         | 900       |
| First Round     | 900          | 90                          | 810       |
| Second Round    | 810          | 81                          | 729       |
| ...             | ...          | ...                         | ...       |
| **Total** | **10,000** | **1,000** | **9,000** |

From the example, we observe that the initial cash deposits were just ₹1000. Banks are able to create total deposits of ₹10,000 which are 10 times of the initial deposits. Ten times is nothing but the value of money multiplier.

Money (or credit) Multiplier = 1 / LRR = 1 / 0.10 = 10
Total demand deposits = Money Multiplier × Cash Reserves
= 10 × 1000 = ₹10,000

**Assumptions:**
(i) All the depositors do not approach the banks for withdrawal of cash at the same time and also they do not withdraw their entire amount.
(ii) All receipts and payments in the economy are made through banks. In other words, all receipts are deposited in banks and all payments are made through cheques.

### 2. Central Bank

#### 2.1 Meaning of Central Bank
Central bank is an apex (supreme) institution in the banking and financial structure of a country. It is the leader of the money market. It supervises, regulates and controls the whole banking and financial system. It is called central bank because it occupies a central position in the monetary and banking structure of the country.
> "Central bank is an apex bank of the monetary and banking structure of a country. It controls the supply of money and credit in the country".

Almost all the countries in the world have their central banks. Reserve Bank of India is the central bank of India which was established on April 1, 1935. The Bank of England was the first to function as a central bank in 1844. Federal Reserve System operates as the Central Bank of USA.

#### 2.2 Distinction Between a Central Bank and Commercial Banks

| Basis             | Central Bank                                                                                      | Commercial Banks                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### 2.3 Functions of a Central Bank

**1. Issue of currency:** The central bank enjoys the sole legal right to issue currency notes. The currency so created is called 'high powered money'. That is why it is called 'Bank of Issue'. These notes circulate throughout the country as legal tender money. Like any other central bank, the RBI has the sole right to issue currency notes. Following are the main reasons for giving the monopoly right of note-issue to the central bank.
(i) It brings about uniformity in note circulation.
(ii) It is easier to control credit when there is a single agency of note issue.
(iii) It keeps the public faith in the paper currency.
(iv) It helps in the stabilization of the internal and external value of the currency.

**2. Banker, Agent and Advisor to the Government:**
* **(a) Banker:** As a banker to the government, it manages the banking accounts of government departments. It performs the same banking functions for the government as commercial bank performs for its customers. It accepts deposits and makes payment for the government. It also gives short period loans to the government.
* **(b) Agent:** As an agent to the government, it buys and sells securities, treasury bills on behalf of the government. It also manages public debt.
* **(c) Advisor:** Central bank gives advice to the government on economic and financial matters such as deficit financing, devaluation of currency, foreign trade policy, foreign exchange policy etc.

**3. Banker to the Banks:** The central bank has the same relationship with the commercial banks as the latter has with the general public. Commercial banks are required to keep a part of their deposits with the central bank in the form of cash. The central bank is the custodian of the cash reserves of the commercial banks.
(i) The central bank uses these reserves to meet the cash requirements of individual commercial banks.
(ii) The central bank supervises, regulates and controls the commercial banks. The supervision of banks may be related to their licensing, branch expansion, management, amalgamation (merging of banks) and liquidation (the winding up of banks).

**What is "Custodian"?**
A custodian means a guardian or keeper - someone who is responsible for looking after and managing something valuable on behalf of others. So, when we say:
* Central bank is the custodian of cash reserves → it keeps the reserves of all banks safely.
* Central bank is the custodian of foreign exchange reserves → it keeps and manages the nation's foreign currencies and gold.

**4. Lender of the Last Resort:** The central bank acts as a lender of the last resort. When a commercial bank fails to meet the obligations of its depositors from all its sources, it can finally approach the central bank. The central bank comes to its rescue and gives loans as lender of the last resort. Central bank gives loans to these banks against the approved securities and bills of exchange. However, commercial banks are supposed to approach other sources first like the call money market and should then only approach the Central bank. That is why, central bank is called the lender of the last resort.

**5. Clearing House Function:** As the custodian of the cash reserves of the commercial banks, the central bank acts as the clearing house for these banks. Since all banks have their accounts with the central bank, the central bank can easily settle the claims of various banks against each other simply by book entries of transfers from and to their accounts. This method of settling accounts is called clearing house function of the central bank. The significance of this function is that it economises the use of money in the banking operations.

**6. Custodian of Nation's Foreign Exchange Reserves:** Central bank is the custodian of nation's foreign exchange reserves. The central bank maintains foreign exchange reserves in order to promote international trade and stabilise exchange rate.

# Tools of Monetary Policy

### 1. Quantitative Methods
Quantitative methods affect the volume of credit in the economy. These methods include the following:

**(a) Bank Rate**
The bank rate is the traditional method of credit control used by a central bank. It is the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks or rediscounts approved first-class bills of exchange and government securities held by the commercial banks. Changes in the bank rate affect the money supply in the economy. The bank rate specifically refers to the interest rate at which a country's central bank lends money to member banks for a long period as a lender of the last resort.
#### Increase in Bank Rate
During inflation (a state of rising prices), the central bank raises its bank rate to control the volume of credit. This increases the cost of borrowing for commercial banks. An increase in the bank rate causes commercial banks to raise their own lending interest rates. This, in turn, discourages businesses and others from borrowing, leading to a reduction in the volume of credit and the money supply.
#### Decrease in Bank Rate
During deflation (a state of falling prices), the central bank reduces the bank rate. This makes borrowing from the central bank cheaper for commercial banks, which then also reduce their lending rates. Businessmen are encouraged to borrow more, which leads to an expansion of credit and the money supply. Consequently, output, employment, income, and aggregate demand begin to rise.

> **Box 6.1: Bank Rate, Repo Rate and Reverse Repo Rate**
> * **Bank Rate:** Bank rate refers to the rate of interest at which country's central bank lends money to member banks for a long period as a lender of the last resort.
> * **Repo rate:** Repo rate (short form of re-purchase option) refers to the market rate of interest at which central bank lends money to banks for short period. Commercial banks get loans from central bank by selling securities to the latter. However, this is a conditional loan. The condition is that banks will repurchase their securities after a fixed time period at a pre-determined price. There is no such condition in case of bank rate. The RBI has replaced bank rate with repo rate to influence the availability of credit and rate of interest in the country.
> * **Reverse Repo Rate:** Reverse repo rate is the rate of interest at which the RBI borrows from commercial banks for short period. This is done by selling government bonds to banks. The banks utilise the reverse repo rate facility to deposit their short term excess funds with the RBI and earn interest on it.

**(b) Open market operations (OMO):** Open market operations refer to the buying and selling of government securities (like National Saving Certificates (NSCs)) by the central bank from/to the public and banks. OMO are used to influence money supply in the country.
* **Sale of Securities:** During the period of excess demand or inflation, the central bank starts selling government securities. As a result, the cash resources of commercial banks are reduced and they are not in position to lend more. This reduces the volume of credit and money supply.
* **Purchase of Securities:** During deficient demand or deflation, the central bank starts purchasing securities. This increases the cash reserves of commercial banks, increasing their lending capacity.

**(c) Cash reserve ratio (CRR):** It refers to the minimum percentage of total demand and time deposits to be kept by commercial banks with the central bank.
* **Increase in CRR:** An increase in CRR reduces the excess reserves of commercial banks and limits their lending power. CRR is raised during inflation.
* **Decrease in CRR:** During deflation, the central bank decreases the CRR. A decrease in CRR increases the banks' excess reserves and thus increases their lending ability.

**(d) Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR):** It refers to the minimum percentage of net demand and time deposits which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves in the form of cash or other liquid assets.
* **Increase in SLR:** The central bank increases the SLR during inflation. This reduces the amount of excess reserves of the banks and their lending ability.
* **Decrease in SLR:** The central bank reduces the SLR during deflation. A decrease in the SLR increases excess reserves of the banks and their ability to give credit.

excess reserves - money for lending
### 2. Qualitative Methods

These methods direct or restrict the flow of credit to specific areas of economic activities.

**(a) Regulation of consumer's credit:** Under this method, the credit given to durable consumer goods is controlled. Durable consumer goods (like motor cars, houses, computers etc.) are purchased under 'Hire Purchase System'.

**(d) Moral suasion:** Under this method, the central bank adopts the policy of persuasion and pressure on the commercial banks in order to get them to fall in line with its policy. The central bank frequently announces its policy and urges the commercial banks to adopt it. This is exercised through letters, discussions and directives to the banks.
