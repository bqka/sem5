### Types of Exchange Rate Systems

Exchange rates determine the value of a country’s currency in terms of foreign currencies. Broadly, exchange rate systems can be classified as **Fixed**, **Flexible (Floating)**, and **Managed Floating**.

#### A. Fixed Exchange Rate System
- **Definition:** A system in which the exchange rate is officially **pegged or fixed** by the government in terms of gold or another currency.  
- **Advantages:**  
  1. Helps coordinate economic policies among countries in an interdependent global economy.  
  2. Prevents major economic distortions in member countries.  
  3. Encourages expansion of international trade by reducing risk and uncertainty in transactions.  
- **Drawbacks:**  
  - Requires large foreign currency or gold reserves.  
  - Restricts independent monetary policy.  
  - Vulnerable to speculative attacks.  
- **Note:** Due to these limitations, many economists prefer **flexible exchange rate systems**.
#### B. Flexible (Floating) Exchange Rate System
- **Definition:** A system in which the value of a currency **fluctuates freely** based on **demand and supply** in the foreign exchange market.  
- **Advantages:**  
  1. Eliminates the need for central banks to hold large international reserves.  
  2. Helps remove barriers to trade and capital movements.  
#### C. Managed Floating System
- **Definition:** A hybrid system combining fixed and flexible exchange rates.  
- The **central bank intervenes** to limit extreme fluctuations but the rate is largely determined by **market forces**.  
- **Purpose:** Provides stability while allowing some flexibility in currency valuation.

## Sources of Demand for Foreign Exchange

Demand for foreign exchange arises when individuals or businesses need foreign currency for various purposes:  
1. Purchase of goods and services from abroad.  
2. Investment in foreign financial assets (bonds, equities).  
3. Direct investment in foreign businesses, factories, or property.  
4. Speculation on the value of foreign currencies.  
5. Sending gifts abroad.
6. Travel and remittances by foreign workers.

## Sources of Supply of Foreign Exchange

Supply arises when foreign currency flows **into the domestic economy**, such as:  
1. Export of goods and services to foreign countries.  
2. Foreign investments in domestic bonds and equity.  
3. Currency dealers and speculators bringing foreign currency.  
4. Remittances sent by domestic workers from abroad.  
5. Foreign tourism spending in the country.

## Determination of Exchange Rate

In a **freely floating market**, the exchange rate of a currency is determined by **demand and supply of foreign exchange in the foreign exchange market.

- **Equilibrium Exchange Rate:** Occurs where the demand for and supply of foreign exchange are equal.
- **Graphical Representation:**  
  - The intersection of the **demand curve (D)** and **supply curve (S)** determines the **equilibrium exchange rate (OR)** and **equilibrium quantity (OQ)**.

### Changes in Exchange Rate

1. **Increase in demand for US dollars (from India):**  
   - The **demand curve shifts right** (D → D1).  
   - Exchange rate rises (OR → OR1), indicating **depreciation of the Indian rupee** (more rupees needed per dollar).

1. **Increase in supply of US dollars (from India):**  
   - The **supply curve shifts right** (S → S1).  
   - Exchange rate falls (OR → OR1), indicating **appreciation of the Indian rupee** (fewer rupees needed per dollar).

### Key Concepts in Foreign Exchange

**Depreciation of Money (Currency Depreciation)**
Depreciation of money means a fall in the value of a country's currency in terms of foreign currencies under a floating exchange rate system. It happens due to market forces (demand and supply of currency).
* Example: If earlier 1 USD = ₹80, but now 1 USD = ₹85, then the rupee has depreciated.

**Causes of Currency Depreciation:**
* High imports and low exports (trade deficit).
* Inflation in the domestic economy.
* High demand for foreign currency.
* Capital outflow (investors pulling money out).

**Opposite of Depreciation = Appreciation of Money (Currency Appreciation)**
Appreciation means an increase in the value of a currency against foreign currencies.
* Example: If earlier 1 USD = ₹80, but now 1 USD = ₹75, then the rupee has appreciated.
